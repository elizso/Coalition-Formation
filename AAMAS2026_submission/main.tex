%\section{Citations and References}
%  
%The use of the \BibTeX\ to prepare your list of references is highly 
%recommended. To include the references at the end of your document, put 
%the following two commands just before the `\verb|\end{document}|' 
%command in your source file:
%%
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{sample}
%\end{verbatim}
%%
%Here we assume that `\texttt{sample.bib}' is the name of your 
%\BibTeX\ file. Use the `\verb|\cite|' command to produce citations 
%to your references. Here are a few examples for citations of journal 
%articles~\cite{GrKr96,WoJe95}, books~\cite{Knu97}, articles in 
%conference proceedings~\cite{Hag1993}, technical reports~\cite{Har78},
%Master's and PhD theses~\cite{Ani03,Cla85}, online videos~\cite{Oba08}, 
%datasets~\cite{AnMC13}, and patents~\cite{Sci09}. Both citations and 
%references are numbered by default. 
%
%Make sure you provide complete and correct bibliographic information 
%for all your references, and list authors with their full names 
%(``Donald E.\ Knuth'') rather than just initials (``D.\ E.\ Knuth''). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%%% (rather than an unnumbered section). The use of this environment 
%%% ensures the proper identification of the section in the article 
%%% metadata as well as the consistent spelling of the heading.

\begin{acks}
If you wish to include any acknowledgments in your paper (e.g., to 
people or funding agencies), please do so using the `\texttt{acks}' 
environment. Note that the text of your acknowledgments will be omitted
if you compile your document with the `\texttt{anonymous}' option.
\end{acks}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The next two lines define, first, the bibliography style to be 
%%% applied, and, second, the bibliography file to be used.

\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format} 
\bibliography{coalition}
