\section{Notations}


\subsection{Coalition Structure (CS)}

\ykc{Formal definition of coalition structure, see Michalak.}
A coalition structure (CS) is the partition of the players into one or more coalitions. For example, when $n=8$, some examples of CS are $\{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5\}, \{6, 7, 8\}\}$, $\{\{1, 7\}, \{2\}, \{3, 5, 8\}, \{4, 6\}\}$, and $\{\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\}$. The last CS where all players form one single coalition is called a grand coalition. 

In the symmetric game, all players are treated equally. As a result, two CSs that are equivalent up to a relabeling of players yield the same reward distribution. Also, within a given CS, all players belonging to coalitions of the same size receive the same rewards. For example, consider the two CSs $\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5, 6\}, \{7, 8\}$ and $\{1, 3, 7\}, \{2, 5, 8\}, \{4, 6\}$ which are equivalent up to a relabeling of players. The rewards received by players 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the first CS are the same as those received by players
1, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8 in the second CS.

This model differs from the standard cooperative game model underpinning Shapley and core values. % TODO%

\section{Dynamic Betrayal Model}

\ykc{any name of the model already in literature? and a more formal mathematical model description for this. Cover foresightedness, give the Ray's example to explain ``short-term'' interest may not align with long-term interest under strategic behaviors of other agents.}
In general, coalition formation dynamics can involve both splitting and merging of coalitions, making the analysis complex. We focus on a simpler model in which only splitting is allowed. Initially, all players belong to a single grand coalition, which may undergo a sequence of splits. This process continues until no player has an incentive to leave her current coalition and form a smaller one; we will define incentive formally below. In each coalition of size $i \geq 2$, there is a player who may initiate a betrayal by pulling at most $i$ players (including herself) away from the rest of the coalition.


\subsection{Nash Equilibrium}

The definition of Nash Equilibrium is the set of strategies such that no player can unilaterally deviate from their strategy to get a higher payoff, given the strategies of all other players. Formally, we can let $A$ to be the set of players, $S_i$ to be the set of strategies available to players, $S$ as the strategy profiles, $u_i$ as the payoff function of each player $i$. Then $s^*\in S$ is a Nash Equilibrium of a strategic game if and only if $\forall i \in A$ and $\forall s_i \in S_i$, 

\begin{eqnarray}
u_i(s^*_i, s_{-i}^*) & \geq & u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*)
\end{eqnarray} 

In this research, as the players are symmetric and all players have a linear demand function $p = A - bx$ with a constant cost $c$, the Nash Equilibrium can be found as follows: 

\begin{eqnarray}
	\frac{(A-c)^2}{bn_C(m+1)^2} = \frac{D}{n_C(m+1)^2}
\end{eqnarray}

where $D = \frac{(A-c)^2}{b}$, $n_C$ is the number of players in coalition $C$, and $m$ is the number of coalitions in the game. 

\ykc{In general, Nash Equilibrium of Cournot competition does not necessarily admit a closed-form solution. We can use Bravo's bandit learning algorithm in this case.}

\subsection{Integer Partition (IP)}

This research has referenced to the Integer Partition (IP) algorithm developed by Rahwan et al. The algorithm first creates a multiset of positive integer whose sum is $n$. For example, $n=8$, the multiset includes $[4, 3, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2]$ and $[3, 3, 2]$. Then it searches the space by coalition size, and eliminates the search spaces where their maximum utility is smaller than the lower bound. 

Our version of IP will enumerate through all the multisets and compute a certain value for them which the computation will be explained in section \ref{sec:dv-func} and \ref{sec:pv-func}. 

A huge advantage of enumerating throught the multisets is to avoid enumerating the set of coalition structure's n players, whose size is larger than $(\frac{n}{\log n })^n$, while the multisets of n has a much smaller size of at most $e^{\Theta(\sqrt{n})}$. 

In the following sections, we will define two value functions $V^D$ and $V^P$, which will be named as the default value function and the pessimistically value function respectively. These values are responsible for defining the stable CS. 

\subsection{Default value function}
\label{sec:dv-func}

The default value function $V^D(S, i)$ is the reward received by any player in a size-$i$ coalition when the CS is fixed. 
For example, $V^D([3], 3) = D/6$, $V^D([2, 1], 2) = D/18$, and $V^D([2, 1], 1) = D/9$. 

\subsection{Pessimistically value function}
\label{sec:pv-func}

The pessimistically anticipated value function $V^P(S, i)$ is the pessimistically anticipated reward (PAR) a player in a size-$i$ coalition might eventually obtain, after any sequence of incentivized betrays by any players.

By incentivized betrayals, we refer to a betrayal initiated by a player such that their PAR with the new CS is strictly better than her default value with the current CS. 

Since coalitions can only be split but not merge in the dynamic betrayal model, $V^P$ can be defined recursively. Let $U$ be the IP $[1, 1, \dots, 1]$, where $1$ occurs $n$ times. This corresponds to the CS where each player forms a coalition by itself. Since no further betrayal can occur from U, $V^P(U, 1)=V^D(U, 1)$. Then $V^P(S, i)$ for any IP $S \neq U$ and $i \in S$ will be defined recursively, going from IPs with the most number of coalitions to the least (the grand coalition).

Before we move forward, we will define a few notation to simplify the presentation. 

\subsubsection{Removal}

Given a multiset $S$ and $i\in S$, let $S - i$ denote the multiset formed by removing S from one occurences of $i$. For example, when $S=[2,2,2,2,1] $, $S-2=[2,2,2,1]$ and $S-1=[2,2,2,2]$. 

\subsubsection{Splitting}

Given a multiset $S$, $i \in S$ and $1 \leq j < i$, let $B(S, i, j)$ 

\subsection{Example}

\ykc{$n=6$ seems a reasonable non-trivial but not too hard example to give people ideas.}

\subsection{Sequential Blocking}

\ykc{Define sequential blocking. Compare with sequential blocking using the ``minimal'' example.}

%\section{Citations and References}
%  
%The use of the \BibTeX\ to prepare your list of references is highly 
%recommended. To include the references at the end of your document, put 
%the following two commands just before the `\verb|\end{document}|' 
%command in your source file:
%%
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{sample}
%\end{verbatim}
%%
%Here we assume that `\texttt{sample.bib}' is the name of your 
%\BibTeX\ file. Use the `\verb|\cite|' command to produce citations 
%to your references. Here are a few examples for citations of journal 
%articles~\cite{GrKr96,WoJe95}, books~\cite{Knu97}, articles in 
%conference proceedings~\cite{Hag1993}, technical reports~\cite{Har78},
%Master's and PhD theses~\cite{Ani03,Cla85}, online videos~\cite{Oba08}, 
%datasets~\cite{AnMC13}, and patents~\cite{Sci09}. Both citations and 
%references are numbered by default. 
%
%Make sure you provide complete and correct bibliographic information 
%for all your references, and list authors with their full names 
%(``Donald E.\ Knuth'') rather than just initials (``D.\ E.\ Knuth''). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%%% (rather than an unnumbered section). The use of this environment 
%%% ensures the proper identification of the section in the article 
%%% metadata as well as the consistent spelling of the heading.

\begin{acks}
If you wish to include any acknowledgments in your paper (e.g., to 
people or funding agencies), please do so using the `\texttt{acks}' 
environment. Note that the text of your acknowledgments will be omitted
if you compile your document with the `\texttt{anonymous}' option.
